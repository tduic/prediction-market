# Roadmap

Features and improvements, roughly ordered by priority within each section.

## Completed

### Single-Process v2 Architecture ✓
Unified `scripts/trading_session.py` runs the ingestor websocket feeds, tick-driven `ArbitrageEngine`, periodic `ScheduledStrategyRunner` (P2–P5 spread-bucket opportunities), and the embedded dashboard in one async process. Replaced the earlier v1 two-service + Redis-queue design.

### Real-Time Price Feeds ✓
Websocket connections to Polymarket's CLOB feed and Kalshi's streaming API. Sub-second price updates drive `ArbitrageEngine.on_price_update()`, which is critical for latency-sensitive cross-market arbitrage. Implemented in `core/ingestor/streamer.py` (one connection per exchange, Polymarket chunked at 450 assets/socket).

### Hot Pair Refresh ✓
`ArbitrageEngine.update_pairs()` supports diffing a new match set against the in-memory index — adds new pairs, drops stale ones, preserves `fired_state` and live prices for retained markets. A background loop in `scripts/trading_session.py` polls cached matches every 30 minutes; if the websocket subscription set changed, it cancels and respawns the Polymarket / Kalshi streams against the new asset and ticker lists. Closes the gap where the weekly `predictor-refresh.service` wrote new matches but the running process kept trading the old set until a restart.

### Web Dashboard ✓
React + FastAPI analytics dashboard served from the same process as the trading session. Shows portfolio overview, per-strategy performance, equity curve, trade log, risk metrics, and fee breakdown. Runs on `--dashboard` flag — no separate terminal needed.

### Paper Execution Client ✓
`execution/clients/paper.py` executes against real market prices without placing orders. Writes identical DB rows to live mode so the full analytics pipeline (dashboard, snapshots, reconciliation) works in paper mode.

### Idempotent Migrations ✓
SQLite migration runner with history tracking (`migration_history` table), duplicate-column-safe ALTER TABLE handling, and automatic migration discovery. 10 migrations to date; migration 010 dropped unused ML tables.

## Go-Live Blockers (All Resolved)

_All blockers resolved. The system is architecturally ready for `EXECUTION_MODE=live`._

### ~~Enforce Risk Controls in Execution Path~~ ✓
All five risk checks (position limit, daily loss, exposure cap, duplicate, min edge) are enforced via `core/signals/risk.py::run_all_checks()` before any order reaches an exchange client. Called inline from `ArbitrageEngine._execute_arb_trade` (P1) and from `core/strategies/single_platform.py` (P2–P5). Failed signals are logged to `risk_check_log` and rejected. All limits are percentage-based, scaling with portfolio value.

### ~~Position Close and Market Resolution~~ ✓
`core/engine/resolution.py` closes positions once their market resolves. Called from `ScheduledStrategyRunner.run_one_cycle` before mark-to-market. Settlement price comes from `markets.outcome_value` when present, falling back to YES/NO label inference. Computes side-aware realized PnL (BUY: `(exit-entry)*size - fees`, SELL reversed), writes `trades` rows, and updates `positions.status` to `resolved` with `resolution_outcome`.

### ~~DB-Level Reconciliation~~ ✓
`core/engine/reconciliation.py` runs three internal-consistency checks every 5 scheduler cycles: orphaned positions (no parent signal), stuck pending orders (>300s), and unbalanced cross-market arb pairs. Discrepancies are written to `reconciliation_log` with `check_type`, `discrepancy`, `status`, and `action_taken` for alerting.

### GCP Deployment Infrastructure ✓
Deployment pipeline for GCE. Main VM (`e2-medium`, us-central1-a) with persistent disk for SQLite at `/data`. Optional EU proxy VM (`e2-micro`, Netherlands) running Dante SOCKS5 for Polymarket API calls. Tar-based deployment via `deploy/push.sh`, systemd service with auto-restart, GitHub Actions CI/CD on release publication.

### Event Loop Fix for Dashboard ✓
The market-match routine processed ~75k markets in a synchronous loop, blocking the asyncio event loop and starving the dashboard server. Fixed by extracting the CPU-bound matching into a sync helper and calling it via `asyncio.to_thread()`.

### Redis Dependency Removed ✓
The v1 signal queue / event bus lived on Redis. After the Phase E rewrite to a single-process tick-driven design, Redis served no purpose. Dropped from `requirements.txt`, the GitHub Actions service container, the `predictor.service` / `predictor-refresh.service` unit dependencies, and `config/settings.example.env`. The running VM no longer needs a Redis install.

## Pre-Launch Checklist

_Required before the first real trade, but not architectural blockers._

### Paper Mode Soak Test (In Progress)
System deployed to GCE and running with ~49k Polymarket + ~26k Kalshi markets. Monitoring for: strategy firing cadence, PnL snapshot accumulation, dashboard accuracy, memory/DB growth stability, and websocket reconnection resilience.

### Credential Rotation and Secrets Management
Production Polymarket and Kalshi API keys currently live in plaintext `.env`. Generate fresh credentials and move them to a secrets vault (GCP Secret Manager or HashiCorp Vault).

### Alerting (Partial)
`core/alerting.py` ships an `AlertManager` with a Discord webhook transport (enabled via `ALERT_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`; the deployed systemd unit already sets it). Wired to invariant-violation checks and reconciliation discrepancies. Remaining: paging rules for stuck positions (open >72h), execution failures (>3 in 10 minutes), and DB errors; optional second transport (PagerDuty or email) for severity tiering.

### Circuit Breaker ✓ (wiring pending live mode)
`execution/circuit_breaker.py` halts trading on daily loss limit, consecutive order failures, or reconciliation discrepancy above threshold. Checked at the start of `ScheduledStrategyRunner.run_one_cycle`. Manual kill switch and on-call dashboard control still TODO.

### Partial Fill Handling
Current behavior assumes a single fill per order. If an order partially fills, the unfilled portion is ignored. Fix: track cumulative fills per order, implement cancel-and-replace for stale partial fills, and ensure position tracking reflects the actual filled quantity.

### Failure Runbook
Documented procedures for: stuck orders, partial fills, exchange API down (HTTP 500), local DB corruption, and position state desync.

## Medium-Term

### Metrics Export
Structured JSON logging is in place, but there's no metrics layer. Planned: Prometheus metrics export, Grafana dashboards, and integration with the alerting system above.

### Backtesting Framework
Use historical `market_prices` and `pair_spread_history` data to replay constraint violations through the signal pipeline. Compare simulated PnL against actual outcomes to validate strategy parameters before deploying changes.

### Multi-Outcome Markets
Current constraint rules assume binary (yes/no) markets. Extending to multi-outcome markets (e.g., "Who wins the election?" with 5+ candidates) requires generalized probability simplex constraints.

### Live Platform API Testing
The Polymarket and Kalshi execution clients have correct auth but haven't been tested against production with real orders. Run read-only API calls (fetch markets, check balances) to verify auth, then place small canary trades on Kalshi demo before production.

## Longer-Term

### Additional Platforms
Extend ingestors and execution clients to support Metaculus, PredictIt, or other prediction market platforms. The platform-agnostic design (market pairs, constraint engine) should make this straightforward.

### Portfolio Optimization
Replace per-signal Kelly sizing with portfolio-level optimization that considers correlation between open positions, joint probability of outcomes, and capital allocation across strategies.
